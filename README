This project provides a tool to read the SamFS faultlog.bin an reports the active faults. This tool is intended for use as nrpe plugin.

Build

For build you need the header files for SamFS from 

$ hg clone ssh://anon@hg.opensolaris.org/hg/samqfs/samqfs

and the libs of the samfs packages SUNWsamfsr and SUNWsamfsu

build with:
$ ./configure --with-samfs-inc=<path to samfs source include dir>
$ make
$ make install

Be sure that the nagios user can access the fault log! 
One solution is add the nagios user to group sys:

# usermod -G sys nagios

and restart nrpe service
